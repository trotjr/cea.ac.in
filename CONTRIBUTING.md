# Loading Files

- Add your html files in the `src` directory (By default `index.html` is added to your `src` directory, feel free to make changes)

- Add images to your `src/assets` folder
- Add sass files to `src/scss` folder

  - Make sure you import the scss file in `main.scss`

    ```sass
    @import "filename";
    ```
    Then restart the development environment

## Note 
After adding html files or any other files webpack hasn't already tracked, make sure you reload the development environment normally with
```
npm start
```
